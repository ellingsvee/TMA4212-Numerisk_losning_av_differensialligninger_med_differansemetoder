# TMA4212 - Numerisk losning av differensialligninger med differansemetoder

 Project 1:

 In this project we studied how finite difference methods can be adapted to solve PDE's on irregular domains. 

  Project 2:

  In this project we studied how finite element methods can be used to solve PDE's, and how the error of the numerical solutions behaves.
